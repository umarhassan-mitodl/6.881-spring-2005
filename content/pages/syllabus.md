Requirements
------------

This reading seminar aims to build up the mathematical background necessary to read papers and follow modern research in computer vision, as well as to improve communication skills, such as presenting research work, reviewing papers, surveying a field.

Everyone participating in the class must read the papers and come to class with questions on the assigned paper and on how it relates to other methods that attempt to solve the same problem.

Everyone will also be expected to present one or two papers during the semester and lead the discussion after the presentation.
